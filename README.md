# Technojam-Task-webDevelopment


  1. I began with the Easy task :
First I added a picture, then with the help of span tag i wrote two lines on it. Then i created a direct link button which will open on a new browser ( basically for providing more detail information about F-35 ). After that i started with the styling part and lastly worked on the responsive part ( gave Dimensions on : ipad Air ).

Im learning web development since this 4th of October. So i just know the basics of html and css. With the help of that I created 3 projects by myself ( Self_madePROJECT_01 ), 
( Self_madePROJECT_02 ), ( Self_madePROJECT_03 ). I didn‚Äôt worked on making them responsive because I made it recently and for now as a beginner it can be tough to make it responsive.

( Self_madePROJECT_01 )  :   This one is my first ever website. Thats the reason it has a so basic interface. Where i mentioned some country's tourist destinations with its military power. Images enlarge on hover.

( Self_madePROJECT_02 )  :   The idea was to create a gaming website where we can discover many amazing games. Features I build are: Enlargment of images on hover and clickable games list.

( Self_madePROJECT_03 )  :   I thought to buld a website on US Air Force, where we can visit and have a detail research of every Fighter Jets which are on service. Though it's not complete yet. But still i learned and created one new feature that is Navigation bar with after hover effect and a scrolling area at any side/part of the website.

2. Challenges I Faced :
(i)    ( EasyTask_01 )To be honest I didn‚Äôt faced any challenges in creating the card as it was just a basic one. 
(ii)   ( Self_madePROJECT_01 ) Took a day to build. Challenging part was the placement of every country section on the webpage.
(iii)  ( Self_madePROJECT_02 ) This was so challenging specially the "more games" lists. Because i added this feature at the very end and that was causing sfhifting movement of 
       the three pictures on the right. Apparently issue was with the width size.
(iv)   ( Self_madePROJECT_03 ) I faced a little problem with the navbar after hover effect. Actually it worked but also on the subtopics of About section. which i fixed later 
       by creating a separate hover effect for those subtopics.

3. My good name is Rakesh Roy. Im from the north part of West Bengal. Siliguri under DARJEELING district. Im from military background. So i almost covered every part of India enjoying different cultures. Seeing the army aviation and vehicles I buildup my interest on Fighter jets. Apart from that I am very much fascinated with aerospace technologies, mechatronics and robotics. Though i don‚Äôt have much detail knowledge about this but im eagerly waiting to grab every opportunity on these fields. I do have an elder cousin brother who recently got placed for frontend develloper. Inspired by him I started web development. My goal is to learn every possible software and language used in web development. Thank you üôèüèª.
